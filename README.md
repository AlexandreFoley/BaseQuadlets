This repo contain quadlet files for my "base" set of quadlet:
- Nextcloud, a cloud system for file sharing across devices and user, with many collaborative tools.
- authelia, a lightweight authentication provider, to secure any of the service you expose to the internet, and provide a Single-Sign-On for those that can interact with OpenId providers.
- lldap, a simple and lightweight identity manager to provide a single source of truth for users identity and identification (usernames and passwords).

Those three services can work together and with many other, but quite a bit of configuration is necessary, especially for authelia.
Go to their respective documentation on the web, it's pretty good.
